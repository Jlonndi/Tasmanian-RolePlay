FAM has the capability of real time monitoring through webhooks, meaning unlike anyother anti-cheat and or script out there You the user can take control...
You have full access to a large ban list the F A M will monitor and update instantly 

Lets give an example of how F A M actually works 

Example: 
-------------
This is server one >>>TRP<<<
This is server two >>>DRG<<<
This is server Three >>>MLG<<<
This is the server for F A M >>>FAM<<<

If somebody cheats on >>>TRP<<<
And gets caught that information is then sent to >>>FAM<<< once FAM
Has that information it will then proceed to send it to >>>DRG<<< and >>>MLG<<< respectively....
    
    This is just a base example Below is another example of what F A M does..
--------------------------------------
Example2:
This is server one >>>TRP<<<
This is server two >>>DRG<<<
This is server Three >>>MLG<<<
This is the server for F A M >>>FAM<<<

Somebody cheats on >>>TRP<<<
TRP notices a patch for it within esx_extended
TRP notes that patch in the LIVENOTES document 
example code "Found an error within es_extended effecting characters on line 218 server.lua
the patch for this can be found here please past this above the or within the characters line
if xPlayer = TestCode then
    stop xPlayer From Deleting Charcters"
Once this code is recieved to F A M it will then be sent to
    >>DRG<<< and >>>MLG<<< respectively And then they can decide to implement this code as a patch or do their own..
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
With F A M you have full range over what you want to recieve and what you dont... If you dont want a certain specific criteria of player banned
you can chose to opt out for example Minor offences But still allow Major offences like modding and injecting etc etc 
You the server Make F A M capable to actually operate through a community effort of communicaton and together
we can stop all modders from getting the upper hand and finally bring back the community
